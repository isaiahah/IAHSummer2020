# RothLabSummer2020
Code I wrote for my time at Dr. Frederick Roth's lab in the summer of 2020, the year before starting first year undergraduate studies.

While there, I was collecting, combining, and analyzing datasets of Protein-Protein interactions between human cell proteins and COVID-19 virus proteins. Past literature was primarily concerned with Yeast-2-Hybrid Assays, where proteins are tagged as "bait" and "prey" and bait-prey interactions can be detected. Literature also concerned changes in RNA regulation, the translateome, the proteome, and protein phosphorylation expressed as log-2-fold changes or p-values.
The work contributed to a currently preprint paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.15.433877).

It is not the cleanest (I was just out of high school!), but demonstrates some of my previous professional work.

If you want a one-file example of my work, I would recommend protein_ranking.py. If you want a second file example, I would recommend dataset_merge.py.

Due to confidentiality reasons, I cannot include the datasets used.
